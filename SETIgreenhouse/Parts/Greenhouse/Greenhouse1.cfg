	@description =  The SETI GreenHouse, made by famous designer zzz, provides 100% of the Food and Oxygen, but only 90% of the Water for up to 1 kerbal. As input resources, it uses all the CarbonDioxide, WasteWater and Waste of 1 kerbal, in addition to Electric Charge and Nutrients, which can be converted from Food. So per kerbal (up to 1 per greenhouse) you only need to supply 10% of the usual amount of Water and 20% of the usual amount of Food (which is converted into Nutrients), to fulfil all their Oxygen, Water and Food needs. Do not forget to switch on the Food - Nutrient Converter!

// We configure SETIgreenhouse1 for 8 kerbals and SETIgreenhouse3 for 24 kerbals. For Snacks! Continued, these much higher numbers are necessary,
// because out of the box, Snacks! Continued already configures the stock Hitchhiker can to support 4 kerbals, at 1 meal per day and 100% recycler efficiency.
//
// Note that this includes the specialist bonus from having a fully trained scientist on board the vessel; with no scientist, the conversion rate is reduced
// to 0.9 times its nominal value.
//
// Since the Hitchhiker is primarily a crew cabin, where the recycler is a secondary functionality, the dedicated greenhouses need higher recycler capacities
// in order to make it sensible to use them.
//
// Balancing considerations:
//
// - stock hitchhiker can:
//     - crew capacity 4, weight 2.5, maxTemp = 1000, skinMaxTemp = 2000
//     - supports 4 kerbals at 1 meal per day, 100% recycler efficiency
//     - soil capacity 200 (special-cased)
//     - snacks capacity #seats * 200 = 4 * 200 = 800 (general rule, crew part with no command module)
// - SETIgreenhouse1
//     - crew capacity 0, weight 2.0, maxTemp = 1200, no separate skinMaxTemp
//     - supports 8 kerbals (can still be lighter than the hitchhiker, by stripping out all other components, leaving only the recycler stuff)
//     - soil capacity 400 (scaled from hitchhiker can by ratio of #supported-kerbals)
//     - snacks capacity 200 (not much storage space left over in the greenhouse, but we should probably have some snack storage to stay within the as-few-extra-parts-as-possible design goal of Snacks!)
// - SETIgreenhouse3
//     - crew capacity 0, weight 6.0, maxTemp = 1200, no separate skinMaxTemp
//     - supports 24 kerbals (scaled from SETIgreenhouse1 by mass ratio; this is also near the volume ratio (3.75 / 2.5)**3 ~ 3.375)
//     - soil capacity 1200 (scaled by ratio of #supported-kerbals)
//     - snacks capacity 600 (scaled from SETIgreenhouse1 by mass ratio)
//
// Kerbal Planetary Base Systems provides a planetary greenhouse, which plays a different role: it is a snack generator, similar to how Snacks! Continued configures the stock science lab.
// It has a much higher production rate and lower ElectricCharge cost than the science lab, presumably because it is a dedicated part, but the science lab has higher ore efficiency, as follows:
//
// - KPBS greenhouse: 0.5 Ore into 1 Snacks using 3 EC (1 Ore = 2 Snacks)
// - science lab: 0.002 Ore into 0.01 Snacks using 30 EC (1 Ore = 5 Snacks)
//
// SETI-Greenhouse does not provide a snack generator, since in orbit, a recycler is more useful.

// The technical details of this config are based on the recycler config provided with Snacks! Continued.
